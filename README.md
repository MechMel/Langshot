# Langshot

We found a slick way to make strongly typed parsers in TypeScript, and are building a language extension framework around it. Very much a work in progress.

### Getting Started

Let's build a super simple parser to parse the following TypeScript snippet:

```ts

```

### Caveats

We have big dreams for Langshot, but right now it's really small and has a lot of limitations.

- Only parsing works right now.
- There is no elegant system for comments yet.
- There is no elegant parser logging system yet.
- There is no elegant system to handle code actively being typed.
